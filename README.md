# Encryption Utility

This project provides a command-line utility for encrypting and decrypting passwords using Caesar cipher and XOR encryption methods.

## Features

- **Caesar Cipher:** Shifts characters in the password by a specified number of positions.
- **XOR Encryption:** Encrypts and decrypts passwords using XOR operation with a key.

## Usage

### Requirements

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
- Standard C++ Library

### How to Use

1. **Clone the repository:**
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/encryption-project.git


2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
cd encryption-project



3. **Compile the source code using `g++`:**
g++ -o main main.cpp


4. **Run the executable:**
./main

5. **Follow the prompts to:**
- Enter a password for encryption/decryption.
- Choose between Caesar cipher and XOR encryption methods.

### Example

Enter a password to encrypt/decrypt: HelloWorld

Enter the shift value for Caesar cipher (integer): 3

Encrypted password (Caesar cipher): KhoorZruog

Decrypted password (Caesar cipher): HelloWorld

Enter the key for XOR encryption: SecretKey

Encrypted password (XOR): GkffoC]kkf

Decrypted password (XOR): HelloWorld

## Future Updates

- **Additional Encryption Methods:** Plans to add more encryption algorithms for enhanced security.
- **Offline Password Storage:** Implementation of features for securely storing encrypted passwords offline.
